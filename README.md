# cint
cint is an integer library for C. It provides basic data structures and algorithms to manipulate and store integers
through a clean, easy to use API. 

## Features
* **Sorting** - basic sorting algorithms are provided including:
    * Quicksort
    * Mergesort
    * Countingsort
    * Heapsort (_coming soon_)
* **Queue & Stack** - basic queue and stack implementations using arrays (_coming soon_).
* **Linked List** - Both singly and doubly linked lists with all basic operations.
* **Hashmap** - Basic hashmaps with different hashing algorithms to help tune performance (_coming soon_). 

## Installation
You can pull cint into your projects int two different ways: download prebuilt library or build locally with CMake. 

### Download Library 
[Github Actions Build Badge Goes Here]
[Github Actions Unit Test Badge Goes Here]
The library files are prebuilt through Github actions, and every release is archived [here]. In order to utilize the prebuilt
files, determine which release you would like to use and download the proper zip file for your platform (OS). Once the files are 
downloaded, extract or unzip the folder. You can do this in any directory, we will be moving files out of this downloaded folder 
into your project. The instructions differ depending on which type of project structure/build system you are using. So jump to the
section that aligns with your project/build system.



### Local Build
You can also clone or download the cint project and build it locally for your platform using CMake.
